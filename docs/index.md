# About

I am a fifth year applied mathematics Ph.D. student at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/) working under the supervision of [Guido Montúfar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/).  In the past I studied primarily the training/optimization process of neural networks, seeking to understand how the parameterization and algorithm influence the properties of the network throughout time and at convergence. Currently, I focus more on developing scalable machine learning methods that respect individual's data usage and privacy rights.

Some of my research interests:
* Machine unlearning
* Data privacy
* Prompt tuning
* Implicit bias/regularization of gradient descent
* Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
* Information-theoretic approaches to generalization

Before [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/) I studied computational mathematics at [Penn State](https://science.psu.edu/math).  Outside of work I enjoy coffee, cooking, and cocktails.
